# Data Channel Service for Streaming Data within or accross companies on nimble

Based on a specified contract negotiated between two
registered companies on nimble, we support data streaming
of machine data.

The DataChannel Service is composed from the following components:
* [Kafka Stack](https://kafka.apache.org/) version **4.0.0** (based on Kafka 0.11) with following subcomponents:
    * Kafka Brokers
    * Kafka Streams
    * Kafka Rest API
    * Custum Kafka-Topic Management service

* SensorThings Server [GOST](https://github.com/gost/server) for semantic description

2. [Usage](#usage)
3. [Backlog](Backlog)
3. [Trouble-Shooting](#Trouble-shooting)


## Requirements

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) version **1.10.0+**
2. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) version **1.6.0+**
3. Clone this repository


## Usage

Using `docker-compose`:

```bash
cd compose
sudo docker-compose up --build -d
```

The flag `-d` stands for running it in background (detached mode):

Watch the logs with:

```bash
sudo docker-compose logs -f
```


As soon as the instances are up, the `dc-service` synchronizes the kafka topics
from the SensorThings instance. During this initialisation phase, the `dc-service`
prevents kafka from any operations that would lead to an error. After restoring
contracts stored in SensorThings new contracts can be submitted and
the output would look like following:

```
Trying to restore kafka topics from SensorThings
kafka-cluster_1  | Created topic "eu.channelID_1.companyID_ownername".
kafka-cluster_1  | Created topic "eu.channelID_2.companyID_ownername".
...
kafka-cluster_1  | Created topic "eu.channelID_N.companyID_Salzburg-Research".
kafka-cluster_1  | dc-service successfully restored all kafka topics from Sensorthings
```


All outputs and commands below are examples of how the `dc-service` can
be used.

### Kafka-Services:

List topic names:
```
http://hostname:8082/topics
```


Get kafka-stack status:
```
http://hostname:3033
```


### Producer services:
Submit a contract to create a new channel
```

This request will return an augmented payload. One important field is
"@iot.dataChannelID" which is an unique identifier for created data-channel.


Send Data on a channel
```
http://hostname:8082/topics/<@iot.dataChannelID>
{
  "records": [
    {
      "key": "998",
      "value": {"iot.id": 998,
	"phenomenonTime": "{% now 'iso-8601', '' %}",
	"resultTime": "{% now 'iso-8601', '' %}",
	"result": 1234.56}
    }
  ]
}
```


### Consumer Services:
Create a Consumer
```
http://hostname:8082/consumers/my-consumer-group
{
  "name": "my_consumer_json",
  "format": "json",
  "auto.offset.reset": "earliest",
  "auto.commit.enable": "false"
}
```


Subscribe Consumer to topics
```
http://hostname:8082/consumers/my-consumer-group/instances/my_consumer_json/subscription
{
  "topics": [
    "<@iot.dataChannelID>"
  ]
}
```

Get Data from Consumer
```GET
http://hostname:8082/consumers/my-consumer-group/instances/my_consumer_json/records?timeout=1000&max_bytes=300000
```


## Backlog



## Trouble-Shooting

* ERROR org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TopicExistsException: Topic 'eu.channelID_10.companyID_Salzburg-Research' already exists.
If data is sent before kafka topics are restored, an error will be returned.

* ERROR in all gost applications: "invalid data found"
There could be a version jump between postgresql 9 and 10, which leads to
invalid data representation. Remove all images involving GOST
